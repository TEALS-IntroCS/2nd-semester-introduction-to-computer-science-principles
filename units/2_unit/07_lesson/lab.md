# Lab 2.07 - Tic-Tac-Toe Revisited

1) For each example below, predict what will be printed. Next, run the program and confirm.

```python
    a = 0
    while a < 10: 
        print(a)
```
| **Predicted Output** | **Actual Output** |
| --- | --- |
|<br> |<br> | 

```python
    a = 0
    while a < 10: 
        a = a + 1
        print(a)
```
| **Predicted Output** | **Actual Output** |
| --- | --- |
|<br> |<br> | 
    
Create a set of test cases for the following sample code and predict the behavior.  
```python
    a = input("Would you like to quit: ")
    while a != "y" and a != "n" :
        a = input("Would you like to quit: ")
```
| **Predicted Output** | **Actual Output** |
| --- | --- |
|<br> |<br> | 

2) Remember the Tic-Tac-Toe game we started to create last week? We are going to keep implementing the game using a while loop.

* Allow users to keep playing (max 9 times).
* Use variables to decide whose turn it is, and greet them as Xs or Os.
* User picks a location on the board according to the number:

* Depending on the position user gave, update the corresponding position of the board to reflect that.
* Print the updated board out.
* You will not need to determine the winner at this point, we will revisit this again and complete the game in Unit 4!

###Bonus! 
Create a variable-sized board. So instead of a classic 3 x 3 board, create a way for the user specify the size of the board they want to play with.
